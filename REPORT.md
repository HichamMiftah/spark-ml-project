# Project Implementation Report

## 1. Real-Time Data Streaming Infrastructure

### Apache Kafka Integration
- **Purpose**: Enable real-time data streaming capabilities for energy consumption data
- **Components Added**:
  - Zookeeper service (port 2181)
  - Kafka broker service (port 9092)
  - Configured topic: "energy_data"
- **Benefits**:
  - Reliable message queuing
  - Scalable data streaming
  - Fault-tolerant architecture

## 2. Data Generation Script (energy_data_generator.py)

### Features
- Simulates real-time energy consumption data
- Generates data points including:
  - Timestamp
  - Building ID
  - Energy consumption (kWh)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Occupancy
  - Time-based features (day of week, hour)
- Sends data to Kafka topic every 5 seconds

### Use Cases
- Testing the streaming pipeline
- Development and debugging
- Demonstration purposes

## 3. Energy Optimization Analysis (energy_optimization_analysis.py)

### Real-Time Analytics
- **Streaming Processing**:
  - Reads data from Kafka in real-time
  - Uses Spark Structured Streaming
  - Processes data in 5-minute windows

### Key Metrics Calculated
- Average energy consumption
- Peak consumption
- Average temperature
- Average occupancy

### Optimization Opportunities Detection
- Identifies high consumption periods
- Alerts for peak demand
- Correlates energy usage with environmental factors

### Data Storage
- Saves analysis results to HDFS
- Maintains checkpoints for fault tolerance
- Enables historical analysis

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- Added requirements.txt with necessary Python packages:
  - kafka-python: Kafka client
  - pyspark: Apache Spark Python API
  - pandas & numpy: Data manipulation

### Integration Points
- Kafka â†” Spark Streaming connection
- HDFS storage integration
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

## 5. Energy Optimization Features

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Peak Detection**:
  - Identifies periods of high energy consumption
  - Alerts when consumption exceeds thresholds

- **Pattern Recognition**:
  - Correlates energy usage with:
    - Time of day
    - Occupancy levels
    - Environmental conditions

### Optimization Recommendations
- Generates alerts for:
  - High consumption periods (>150 kWh)
  - Peak demand events (>180 kWh)
  - Abnormal usage patterns

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Machine learning models for prediction
- More sophisticated anomaly detection
- Interactive visualization dashboard
- Automated optimization recommendations

## 7. Usage Instructions

### Starting the System
1. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the data generator:
   ```bash
   python scripts/energy_data_generator.py
   ```

3. Start the analysis:
   ```bash
   python scripts/energy_optimization_analysis.py
   ```

### Accessing Results
- Real-time analysis: View console output
- Historical data: Access HDFS storage
- Kafka topics: Monitor using Kafka tools
